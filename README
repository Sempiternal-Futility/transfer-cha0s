Transfer-Cha0s is a program that can copy files between two computers.
It's written in C with ncurses


The program is still being developed and it's far from done!

Some of the features i plan on implementing are:

1- Transfer folders
2- Add a list of things to send and then send it all at once
3- While typing the path to a file, have a "list" button that can kind of "ls" the current directory
4- Add different color schemes
5- Use the "~/.config" instead of its own
